BluePotion
-----------

BluePotion is maintained by [Infinite Red](http://infinite.red), a web and mobile development company based in Portland, OR and San Francisco, CA.

## Prerequisites

  - RubyMotion android: `motion android-setup` (install API 16)
  - Gradle: `brew install gradle`
  - GenyMotion Emulator (optional) [Gant Laborde's post on Genymotion](http://www.iconoclastlabs.com/blog/rubymotion-android-in-the-emulator-with-genymotion).
  - For running on your device, [do this](http://www.kingoapp.com/root-tutorials/how-to-enable-usb-debugging-mode-on-android.htm)

## Warning, BluePotion is an alpha release.

BluePotion is the Android version of [RedPotion](http://redpotion.org). It's currently in Alpha.

Many things work, but there is a lot to do, so use it at your own risk.

To try it out:

```
gem install bluepotion
bluepotion create myapp
cd myapp
bundle
brew install gradle # if gradle is not installed. Requires homebrew
rake gradle:install

# Start your Genymotion virtual device or plug in your Android device

rake newclear
```

In your REPL, do this for fun:

```
rmq.log_tree
find(Potion::View).log
# etc
```

If you haven't setup Android yet, read this first: [Gant Laborde's post on Genymotion](http://www.iconoclastlabs.com/blog/rubymotion-android-in-the-emulator-with-genymotion).
